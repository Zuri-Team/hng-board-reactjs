Make sure you have eslint and prettier extensions installed in your code editor or IDE. Make eslint your default formatter. If you're using vscode, this has already been done for you in `.vscode`. save a file to format it or run `npm run lint:fix` to lint the whole codebase. You can also run `npm run lint` to view all the linting errors and warnings in the codebase
